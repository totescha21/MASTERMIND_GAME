# MASTERMIND_GAME
This Python project is an implementation of the classic Mastermind game. Players are given 10 attempts to guess a randomly generated 4-color code from a set of six possible colors. The game provides real-time feedback on correct guesses, indicating the number of correct colors in both the right and wrong positions.
